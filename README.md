# Network Fundamentals
* Currently, only contains python 3 networking fundamentals examples, tools, and demonstrations.
    * It will include other languages and implementations in the future.
    * All implementations in python 3 also have working libraries in python 2 unless explicitly noted.
* TODO:
    * Include both passive and aggressive security concepts and implementations.
    * Confirm ports from python 2 code to python 3.
    * Include better documentation and updated programming practices.
    * List sources of code examples/inspiration.
